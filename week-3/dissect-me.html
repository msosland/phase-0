          <p>
            In today's piece, I am going to introduce you lovely people to version control, git, and Github.
          </p>
          <p>
            Version control is a system of keeping track of changes made on a project over time. The project is not limited to the realm of programming and may be any sort of document, presentation, image, video, or other content that goes through changes. The opposite of version control might be when a file is overwritten every time it is edited and saved. When it is overwritten, it might not be possible to go back to different states or undo changes made. Version control allows users to go back in time to various checkpoints throughout a project. This system is useful for large projects where many edits will take place and some might later need to be discarded, and it is also especially useful for when multiple people are working on the same project and making several edits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Git is an implementation of a version control system that can be run locally in a terminal. Git provides a history of content changes and is approachable for any type of project. It also facilitates collaboration between users by having the ability to branch a project into multiple workflows and later merge them back. Git is lightweight, straightforward, and fast. I will repeat, though, that Git is essentially local, on a user's machine. A remote resource that can used alongside Git is Github.
          </p>
          <p>
            Github is a remote resource that allows users to collaborate on projects using Git. Through the Github website, users can access a master version of a project and download it locally to their machines, as well as to their own Github accounts. Then, when they are done making changes, editing, or adding new features, they can upload their work back to Github in the form of a pull request. A pull request essentially uploads work back to the Github servers and posts it for review, evaluation, and possible merging into the master version of the project. Github also allows multiple users to have access to the files both online and locally, which is a good way to ensure the files do not get lost. And, since all the work is done locally, users can simultaneously be working on the same file and then upload their branches back to the online location.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be clear, some merges are simpler than others. If users are all working on different areas of code in a large file, merging might be relatively straightforward. Other times, users might simultaneously be making changes to the same parts of code. However, even in that case, Github places the changes side by side so that collaborators can make decisions on which code to keep. And as with Git locally, Github will log all of the changes made in the project's repository, so that at any time users can access various version checkpoints.
          </p>
          <p>
            So that's my introduction to version control, Git, and Github. Until next time.....</p>

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  I tried to use as many of the non-div semantic elements as I could. So I used
  header, footer, article, section, main, aside, and nav. I think it is very useful
  to separate all the "extras" out, like header, footer, nav, and aside first, and
  then I try to think about how to section the rest of the content.
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  The new semantic elements in HTML5 allow a machine or screenreader to understand
  the hierarchy of the page much easier than when almost all sections were divs.
  The header and footer tags separate content out that is not really in the main
  part of the page. The aside and nav tags separate out sidebars and navigational
  links that are not critical to the main content of the page. The main tag hones in on the important content, with the section tags helping to divide it up, and
  the article tag specifies what is really the potentially reproduceable media
  content from the page.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  Having a saved html skeleton is a very useful tool to create an html page,
  especially one that is similar to others I have made. I think I will first clean
  up my blog-template html page, and possibly save that as a snippet (though I
  have also just been copying and pasting my code into new blog posts). Tab is also
  useful in sublime to finish typing out tags. Those are the only ones I have used
  so far but I will check out others...
