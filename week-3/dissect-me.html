          <p>
            In today's piece, I am going to introduce you lovely people to version control, git, and Github.
          </p>
          <p>
            Version control is a system of keeping track of changes made on a project over time. The project is not limited to the realm of programming and may be any sort of document, presentation, image, video, or other content that goes through changes. The opposite of version control might be when a file is overwritten every time it is edited and saved. When it is overwritten, it might not be possible to go back to different states or undo changes made. Version control allows users to go back in time to various checkpoints throughout a project. This system is useful for large projects where many edits will take place and some might later need to be discarded, and it is also especially useful for when multiple people are working on the same project and making several edits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Git is an implementation of a version control system that can be run locally in a terminal. Git provides a history of content changes and is approachable for any type of project. It also facilitates collaboration between users by having the ability to branch a project into multiple workflows and later merge them back. Git is lightweight, straightforward, and fast. I will repeat, though, that Git is essentially local, on a user's machine. A remote resource that can used alongside Git is Github.
          </p>
          <p>
            Github is a remote resource that allows users to collaborate on projects using Git. Through the Github website, users can access a master version of a project and download it locally to their machines, as well as to their own Github accounts. Then, when they are done making changes, editing, or adding new features, they can upload their work back to Github in the form of a pull request. A pull request essentially uploads work back to the Github servers and posts it for review, evaluation, and possible merging into the master version of the project. Github also allows multiple users to have access to the files both online and locally, which is a good way to ensure the files do not get lost. And, since all the work is done locally, users can simultaneously be working on the same file and then upload their branches back to the online location.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be clear, some merges are simpler than others. If users are all working on different areas of code in a large file, merging might be relatively straightforward. Other times, users might simultaneously be making changes to the same parts of code. However, even in that case, Github places the changes side by side so that collaborators can make decisions on which code to keep. And as with Git locally, Github will log all of the changes made in the project's repository, so that at any time users can access various version checkpoints.
          </p>

            So that's my introduction to version control, Git, and Github. Until next time.....</p>
