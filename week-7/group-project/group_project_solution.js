//User stories by Marshall Sosland

// As a user, I want to have a function called sum that can iterate through an array and add all the elements of the array.

// As a user, I want to have another function called mean that can find the average of all the numbers in an array.

// As a user, I also want to have a function called median that can find the median of all the numbers in an array.
//I really want it to work for both arrays with an odd number of elements and those with an even number of elements!
