    - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
        It was good to practice using the tags and seeing the code become an actual website. It is interesting to see that some massive companies have very simple websites.
    - How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
        It seemed a little overwhelming but eventually starting to sink in. I am still confused over when to use div tags versus section tags in the new html5. I think it was harder to tell in this website because there is barely any formatting anyway even in the actual version.
    - How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
        We did not format anything. We used headings tags and div tags with no formatting. We tried to think about structural tags only. There was also very little temptation to format since the actual website is so basic.
    - What seems good and bad about HTML?
        It seems like a pretty straightforward way to structure a webpage and especially with the new structure tags it is versatile enough to set a page however the developer wants.
    - What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
        I just try to focus on structure only and not worrying about formatting. I will read a little more about the section tags to figure out when to use them in place of divs.
